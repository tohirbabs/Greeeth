## GREETH Project
Greeeth is a carbon footprint calculator, analyzer, and offsetting platform by planting of tree and getting users rewarded with point to users/planters and this point can be converted to a coupon code which can be used to get discounts purchase from platforms that support and partner with our project. 

## THE ISSUE
Greenhouse gases pose severe environmental and health issues. They cause climate change by trapping heat, which affects various species, humans, and the environment. CO2 is a major greenhouse gas in the atmosphere with a high record of 36.7 billion metric tons. The climate change caused by carbon emissions also contributes to extreme weather, wildfires, droughts, and food shortage.

## THE SOLUTION
A platform that allows people to plant a tree which will be geo-tagged and registered on the blockchain which is viewable in a 3D-Simulated environment.
DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT
The project is divided into the following 6 categories: calculate carbon footprint, detecting a planting location, sending a planting location to user, planting types, cloud, reward.

**1.	CALCULATE CARBON FOOTPRINT**
We developed a carbon footprint calculator for individuals which is free to use on the platform to calculate their carbon footprint from different categories. Majority of daily activities generate carbon footprint ranging from transportation, energy used (KW), product purchased, food, and lot more. 

**Food **
Global food production contributes about 17.3 billion metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year, almost 19 times the amount from the commercial aviation industry. A large proportion of greenhouse gas emissions comes from food production, and meat and diary are associated with much higher carbon emissions than plant-based food.

**Transportation**

Transportation is the fastest growing source of emissions worldwide, and now accounts for 17% of global greenhouse gas emissions. There are now more people and goods on the move than ever before, and each year hundreds of millions of vehicles pump huge amount of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere, driving climate crises. 

**Home Energy**
How we use energy at home plays a big part in your carbon impact on the world.

**Product Purchased **

With global production sectors responsible for one-fifth of carbon emissions consuming 54% of the world’s energy sources. This makes the production process requires massive amounts of energy. 

For organizations we will be having an expert who will calculate the footprint and give a depth analysis on how to reduce their footprint using the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Scope which includes the following.

	Scope 1 Direct Emission (Owned Assets): These emissions are generated Companies Facilities, Equipment, Vehicles, Onsite Landfills, etc.

	Scope 2 Indirect Emissions (Energy Purchased): These emissions are generated from Purchased Electricity, Purchased Heating, Purchased Cooling, etc.

	Scope 3 Indirect Emission (3rd Party): These emissions are generated from Transportation, Distribution, Waste, Energy and Fuel, Leased Asset, Travel.
for small businesses we will be creating a footprint calculator that can easily be used to get their estimated footprint of their footprints. The data used will be an average data per capita to calculate the footprint. 

We understand not everybody will be able to answered technical questions about  to input data for their footprint and that’s why we are creating the footprint in form of a questionnaire that can be easily understood and answered. The values of their footprint will then be stored in their dashboard. 
Life Cycle Analysis: Our team evaluates the environmental impact of a product through its life cycle encompassing extraction and processing of the raw materials, manufacturing, distribution, use, recycling, and final disposal which will be updated to their dashboard.

**2.	 DETECT PLANTING LOCATION**
First, we are going to obtaining data on vulnerable location, especially places where the emission is very high. The locations would be verified by the CO2 emission data from the government and data publicly available. After we identify the most vulnerable locations, these locations would be mapped out to have an access by individuals/communities/locals. 
For organization that wants to offset their footprint and want their business to be carbon neutral, and wants to get part in the planting process they can easily get involved as a sponsor  on the Greeeth platform and create a project, with this they can bring in individuals in a particular location to take part in the planting project and this individuals gets rewarded in points. The organization/business will also be able to provide resources that will be needed in the plating process. 
We are going to partner with planting trees organizations around the world that can also take part in planting. Then, finally we can choose the planting space manually and send a signal of planting foundation with the location. This will allow companies to partner with this organizations to carry out the planting project for them on the platform. 

In Summary for how we detect planting location
•	We get data on vulnerable location
•	We check for planting locations and partner with tree planting organizations around the world.
•	Individual/communities/locals can map out planting locations on the map
•	Check locations with more CO2 emissions on the map and plant
•	Choose where to plant manually 
•	Vet planting foundation with location

**	SEND PLANTING LOCATION TO USER **
We are going to send planting mapped out locations to planters where they can find a planted tree. This will give an opportunity for a planter to take part in the planting process. Moreover, planters will get recommendations on tree types and planting patterns with our pattern generator. Auto-generated planting patterns will beautify the environment and still fight climate change.

**3.	PLANTING TYPE**
Trees can be planted by two following ways: 

**A.	PLANTING BY HUMAN **

Planters plant trees in locations easily accessible by a human. Planters plant the tree and geotag it on the platform and get on-field data such as GPS coordinates, pictures, videos and timestamps.  

**B.	AUTONOMOUS SEED FIRING DRONE**

We use an unmanned autonomous drone to plant seeds by firing when planting in a large area or location that is not easily accessible by planters.
We can plant up to 100,000 seeds daily, which is faster and easier than planting by a human. 
The drone goes to a high altitude and uses pressure to fire the seedpod from the sky to make it spread out effectively.  We get on field data of the seedpod planted such as GPS coordinates, pictures, video of the planting process and timestamps. Moreover, drone can do: Terra Mapping and Soil Analysis. All trees planted are visible in the interactive map.
Data gotten from the drone will be available on the dashboard. 

**4.	CONFIRMATION**
The platform automatically confirms the tree planted by crosschecking the coordinate and validates the task. 

**5.	CLOUD **
Trees planted get connected to the cloud and are visible in the interactive map. This will improve the forest database and would help improve sustainability, transparency, connectivity, and accessibility to the public and government. Having the data on cloud will save time and money. 
 6. REWARD
Planters earn point for the planting task carried out when confirmed. This point can be converted to a coupon code which can be used to get discounts purchase from platforms that support and partner with our project. 

With this solution, we will create:

#	A single network for forest data
#	Traceability and transparency for the tree planted and wood in supply chains
#	Halt the idea of deforestation 
#	A cross-border investment opportunity 
#	A new way to preserve forests and tackle climate change without increasing budget 
#	Accountability 
#	No double counting 
#	Validity 

**GREEETH Interactive Map**
Greeeth is an interactive map that allows people to view the carbon footprint, carbon offset, forestry, deforestation, wildfire and lot more related to GHG Emission and climate change with the latest data, technology and tools.
